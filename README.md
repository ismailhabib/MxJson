# MxJson
Mendix JSON Serializer/Deserializer

MxJson is a module which provides out of the box functionality to serialize Mendix object to JSON and deserialize JSON to Mendix object. MxJson is shamelessly extracted from the popular Mendix RestServices (https://github.com/mendix/RestServices) with some changes: every referenced objects is embedded within JSON and support for `primitive` is dropped.
